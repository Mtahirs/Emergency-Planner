This project uses [Babel Standalone](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-standalone) to transpile JSX directly in the browser. This is great for simple projects and demos but is not recommended for production applications due to performance considerations. For a production build, you would typically use a build tool like [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) or [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/).
